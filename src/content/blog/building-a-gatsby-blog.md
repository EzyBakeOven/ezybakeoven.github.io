# Building a Blog with Gatsby and GitHub Pages

In this post, I'll walk you through how I built this blog using Gatsby and deployed it on GitHub Pages, integrating it seamlessly with my existing portfolio site.

## Why Gatsby?

Gatsby is an excellent choice for building a blog because it offers:

- **Static Site Generation** - Fast loading times and great SEO
- **React-based** - Familiar development experience
- **Rich Ecosystem** - Tons of plugins for markdown, images, and more
- **GitHub Pages Integration** - Easy deployment workflow

## The Setup Process

### 1. Adding Blog Plugins

First, I added the necessary Gatsby plugins to handle markdown files:

```bash
npm install gatsby-transformer-remark gatsby-remark-prismjs prismjs
```

### 2. Configuring Gatsby

Updated `gatsby-config.js` to include the blog source and transformer:

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    name: `blog`,
    path: `${__dirname}/src/content/blog`,
  },
},
`gatsby-transformer-remark`,
`gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
```

### 3. Creating the Blog Structure

I organized my blog posts in `src/content/blog/` with markdown files that include frontmatter metadata:

```markdown
---
title: "My Blog Post"
date: "2024-01-15"
description: "Post description"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
author: "Matt Hoy"
---
```

## Key Features

### Syntax Highlighting

The `gatsby-remark-prismjs` plugin provides beautiful syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```javascript
const example = () => {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
  return "This is highlighted!";
};
```

### Responsive Design

The blog integrates with my existing Material-UI and Tailwind CSS setup for a consistent, responsive design.

### SEO Optimization

Gatsby automatically generates meta tags and structured data for better search engine visibility.

## Deployment

The blog is deployed using GitHub Pages with a simple deployment script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public -b main"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

I'm planning to add:

- **Tag-based filtering** - Browse posts by topic
- **Search functionality** - Find posts quickly
- **Comments system** - Engage with readers
- **RSS feed** - Subscribe to updates
- **Related posts** - Discover more content

## Conclusion

Building a blog with Gatsby has been a great experience. The static site generation ensures fast loading times, while the React ecosystem makes it easy to add features and maintain the codebase.

The integration with my existing portfolio site creates a cohesive online presence that showcases both my work and my thoughts on technology.
